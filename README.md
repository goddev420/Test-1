**User requests:**
Create an application that utilizes deepseek r1 latest that auto snipes solana tokens from twitter accounts in real-time, so that the second they post an contract address, pump fun link, or ticker the bot will auto buy the token. The application needs to be able to integrate real time twitter api, solana rpcs, mev protect with buy settings such as priority fee, slippage and buy settings. The bot needs to be able to monitor up to 20 accounts at a time. The bot needs to be able to use private keys from a solana wallet to store sol that is used to snipe the tokens. The bot needs to be able to create a phantom wallet with ability to export keys from the wallet. The bot needs to be able to make the trades from pump.fun, jupiter, meteora, raydium or any solana exchange where the token has liquidity.

## Project Plan
```
Here’s a **simple and clear project plan** based on the requirements provided, broken down into main tasks and technical considerations:

---

### **Project Plan: Solana Token Sniper Application**

---

### **Phase 1: Project Setup and Initialization**  
**Tasks:**  
1. **Define Project Structure**  
   - Set up a repository (e.g., GitHub) with folders for backend, frontend, and documentation.  
   - Choose a framework (Python, Node.js, or Rust) based on team expertise and project needs.  

2. **Environment Setup**  
   - Install necessary libraries:  
     - **Tweepy** (Twitter API)  
     - **Solana Web3.js** or **Anchor** (Solana integration)  
     - **Phantom SDK** (wallet management)  
   - Set up Solana RPC endpoints and MEV Protect API keys.  

---

### **Phase 2: Core Feature Development**  
**Tasks:**  
1. **Twitter Monitoring Module**  
   - Integrate with the Twitter API to monitor **20 accounts** in real-time.  
   - Implement logic to detect **contract addresses**, **Pump.fun links**, or **tickers** from tweets.  
   - Handle Twitter API rate limits to avoid account suspension.  

2. **Auto-Snipe Functionality**  
   - Develop a module to parse detected token-related posts and extract relevant data (e.g., contract address).  
   - Implement logic to initiate trades using **private keys** from a Solana wallet.  

3. **Multi-Exchange Integration**  
   - Implement connections to **Pump.fun**, **Jupiter**, **Meteora**, and **Raydium** via their respective APIs.  
   - Add logic to choose the best exchange based on liquidity and user settings.  

4. **MEV Protection**  
   - Integrate **MEV Protect API** to secure transactions and prevent front-running.  

5. **Phantom Wallet Integration**  
   - Use the **Phantom SDK** to create and manage wallets within the application.  
   - Implement functionality to export **private keys** securely.  

6. **Customizable Buy Settings**  
   - Develop a user interface or configuration file for users to set:  
     - **Priority fee**  
     - **Slippage tolerance**  
     - **Buy amount**  

---

### **Phase 3: Testing and Optimization**  
**Tasks:**  
1. **Unit Testing**  
   - Test individual modules (Twitter monitoring, trade execution, etc.) for functionality and edge cases.  

2. **Integration Testing**  
   - Test the end-to-end workflow: Twitter post detection → token parsing → trade execution.  

3. **Performance Optimization**  
   - Optimize for low latency in trade execution.  
   - Ensure scalability for monitoring **20 Twitter accounts** simultaneously.  
   - Minimize Solana RPC usage to avoid rate limits and high costs.  

4. **Security Testing**  
   - Verify that private keys are securely handled and not exposed.  
   - Test MEV protection functionality to ensure transaction security.  

---

### **Phase 4: Documentation and Delivery**  
**Tasks:**  
1. **User Documentation**  
   - Create a **README** file with setup instructions, configuration details, and usage examples.  
   - Provide example configurations for buy settings and wallet management.  

2. **Developer Documentation**  
   - Document the codebase, including module descriptions and API integration details.  

3. **Deliverables**  
   - Deliver a fully functional application with all features.  
   - Provide example configurations and test cases.  

---

### **Technical Considerations**  
1. **Programming Languages/Frameworks**  
   - Use **Python** or **Node.js** for ease of development and libraries like **Tweepy** and **Web3.js**.  
   - Consider **Rust** for performance-critical components (e.g., trade execution).  

2. **APIs and Integrations**  
   - **Twitter API**: Handle rate limits and ensure real-time monitoring.  
   - **Solana RPCs**: Optimize usage to avoid rate limits and costs.  
   - **MEV Protect API**: Ensure secure transactions.  
   - Exchange APIs: Implement multi-exchange support for liquidity options.  

3. **Security**  
   - Securely store and handle private keys using encryption and best practices.  
   - Use MEV protection to prevent front-running and ensure fair trade execution.  

4. **Scalability**  
   - Optimize for low latency and high throughput to handle up to **20 Twitter accounts** and multiple trades simultaneously.  

5. **Latency and Reliability**  
   - Minimize the time between Twitter post detection and trade execution.  
   - Ensure reliability by handling API failures and retries gracefully.  

---

### **Timeline (Example)**  
- **Week 1-2**: Project setup, Twitter API integration, and wallet management.  
- **Week 3-4**: Auto-snipe functionality and multi-exchange integration.  
- **Week 5**: MEV protection and customizable buy settings.  
- **Week 6**: Testing, optimization, and documentation.  
- **Week 7**: Final delivery and user support.
